# 10.7 - Basic Coding Skills
# 1. Code a program in a .py file that displays "Hello Python" on the console

print("Hello Python")

# 2. Change that program to use two print statements... the first displays "Hello" and the second displays "Python" on the next line of the console.

print("Hello")
print("Python")

# 3. Change that program, to indent the second print statement by two spaces and run it. Then correct the error and run it again.

print("Hello")
print("  Python")

# 4. Add a single line comment by itself and a single line comment that is placed on the same line as the first print statement. Run your program again to be sure it stills works.

print("Hello Python") # output should still be Hello Python
