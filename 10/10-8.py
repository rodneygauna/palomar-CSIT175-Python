# 10.8 - Data Types & Variables
# Code a program in a .py file that displays "Hello John you are now 30 years old" on the console using the criteria below...
# 1. Store the value of "John" in a variable and give the variable a name that is meaningful and that does not violate any variable naming rules. Remember that this variable may be used later for storing other values that are not named "John"

first_name = "John"

# 2. Store the value of "30" in a variable and give the variable a name that is meaningful and that does not violate any variable naming rules. Remember that this variable may be used later for storing other values that are not "30".

age = 30

# 3. Use a print function to display "Hello John you are now 30 years old" but use the variable names in the print statement not the actual values conceptually, "Hello name-variable you are now age-variable years old"

print("Hello " + first_name + " you are now " + str(age) + " years old")

# 4. Run the program.
# 5. Copy the two variable assignment statements and the print statement and paste them below the original code in the program.
# 6. Change the last two variable assignment statements to use "Jane" and "22" respectively as their values. Do NOT change the 2nd print statement!

first_name = "Jane"
age = 22
print("Hello " + first_name + " you are now " + str(age) + " years old")
